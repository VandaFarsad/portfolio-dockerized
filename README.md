# Portfolio Dockerized

A dockerized Django web application for a developer portfolio.

The Hero and About Me sections can be customized via the Admin page. Skills and projects can also be added and removed
via the admin page.

This code serves to demonstrate my way of working.

## Tools Used

Below are a list of tools and helpers I used:

- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for hambuger menu bar
- [Drawkit](https://www.drawkit.io/) for working man illustration
- [Icon8](https://icons8.com/) for social media and skills icons
- [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/) for Hero section animation
- [Ksound22](https://github.com/Ksound22/developer-portfolio/) template for the front end
